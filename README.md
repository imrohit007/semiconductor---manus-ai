# Interactive Semiconductor Physics Learning Platform

This is an interactive web application for learning semiconductor physics, initially generated by Manus AI and subsequently modified to fix errors and improve the UI.

## Important Note About This Project

This project was originally created by Manus AI in response to the prompt:

> "I have attached a PDF of the Semiconductors chapter from a Class 12 Physics textbook. Based on this chapter, create a fully interactive, visually engaging, and modern web app that makes learning this topic as easy and immersive as possible. Use animations, simulations, and visual explanations to simplify complex semiconductor concepts. Organize topics into bite-sized lessons with interactive explanations. Ensure the design is modern, intuitive, and mobile-friendly, catering to students of all learning paces."

While Manus AI successfully generated a functional codebase, it had some initial errors that needed fixing. The educational content is derived from the provided PDF and **has not been independently verified**. This demonstrates both the capabilities and current limitations of AI in educational content creation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Content Verification Status

- All semiconductor physics content is AI-generated and based on a single source
- The accuracy of the content needs community verification
- Some technical explanations may require expert review
- Animations and simulations may need calibration for accurate representation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v19.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v9.0.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd book
```

2. Install dependencies (with force if needed):
```bash
# Regular installation
npm install

# If you encounter dependency conflicts
npm install --force
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter dependency conflicts, try these steps:

1. Clear npm cache:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

2. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

3. Reinstall with force:
```bash
npm install --force
```
