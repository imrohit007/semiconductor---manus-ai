## Project Background

This project was originally generated by Manus AI based on the following prompt:

> "Build an online web app portal that displays state-wise common diseases in India, categorized separately for men and women. Show the primary causes behind these diseases and recommended measures for treatment and prevention. If possible, further categorize the data age-wise. Use a clean and intuitive UI for easy navigation, ensuring the data is well-structured and visually engaging"

### Important Note About Data

The disease prevalence data and health information used in this project are currently **mock data** generated for demonstration purposes. The data is:
